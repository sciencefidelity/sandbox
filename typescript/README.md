# TypeScript

The TypeScript suite uses the built in `ts-node-dev` to re-run the app on save and it uses `jest` for its tests:

Commands:

```shell
# run project
yarn ts-node-dev ./index.ts

# start the app
yarn watch

# run the tests
yarn jest

# start the test suite
yarn test

# check test coverage
yarn coverage

# lint project
yarn lint

# auto fix lint errors
yarn fix

# format code
yarn format
```
