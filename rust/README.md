# Challenge

This repo is a collection of simple environments in various languages that interest me. I use these templates for test driven development of functions to solve coding challenges or for use as utilities in apps.

There are a few things that were essential to the process, both the app and the test suite sould run uninterrupted, and update on save. The test suite output should be highlighted and semantic.

# Rust

To run the project `cargo run`

<!-- To run the tests `cargo test` -->

```shell
# run project
cargo run

# start the app
# cargo watch -c -w src -x run
# fswatch -o -1 -d src | (while read; do cargo run; done)

# run the tests

# start the test suite

# format code
```
